This folder contains the last of three Instagram-like projects for 4Geeks. In this project, we were asked to use Bootstrap to replicate an Instagram-like page with a header line, toggleable icons that are essentially tabs (/pills) so that on the one html page you can select between different panes that show either a grid of pictures or a column of single pictures with headings that include a title and date, and a footer with an image description (reference folder 'insta_bootstrap'). The header includes two dropdowns, one using a modal and one with a basic dropdown menu.

To run the project, enter the command:
$ python3 server.py

Note that I imported the server.py file from the codespace on github for this project, so it was not written by me. I wrote the index.html file. I did sometimes modify the server.py file by changing the index.html to insta_bootstrap.html to ensure that it works.
